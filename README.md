**Open Twitch Assistent** is a free open source project targeting streamers to improve the viewers experience and giving interactive features to their community like Twitch Extensions, Chatevents and so on.
Written in PHP8 with [Ext-Swoole](https://github.com/swoole/swoole-src), it's shipped with an internal webinterface, open API and plugins system to make **Open Twitch Assistent** easy extensible and customizable unlike Cloud Services like Streamelements or closed source projects like deepbot.

Since it's an open source project you are free to fork and make pull requests.
