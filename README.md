# Open Twitch Assistent
**Open Twitch Assistent** is a free open source project targeting streamers to improve the viewers experience and giving interactive features to their community like Twitch Extensions, Chatevents and so on.
Written in PHP8 with Ext-Swoole, it's shipped with an internal webinterface, open API and plugins system to make **Open Twitch Assistent** easy extensible and customizable unlike Cloud Services like Streamelements or closed source projects like deepbot.

The coding process is streamed on [Twitch](ttps://www.twitch.tv/Kapsonfire), so you can give feedback live on the streams or ask me anyting. Since it's an open source project you are free to fork and make pull requests.
If I'm not live, you can write on [Issues](https://github.com/Kapsonfire-DE/OpenTwitchAssistent/issues) or the official [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwitchAssistent/).
